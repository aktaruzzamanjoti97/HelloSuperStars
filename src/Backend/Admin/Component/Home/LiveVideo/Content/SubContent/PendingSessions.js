                <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
                collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
                control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
                modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting
                that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition
                does limit overflow.
